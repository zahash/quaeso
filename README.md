Is it just me or is curl a little too complicated?
Want something simpler in life? something made for humans? Try quaeso -- A Python program that reads a json/yml file for request data and sends the request

## Installation

pip install this repo.
(Note: Incompatible with Python 2.x)

```sh
pip3 install quaeso
```

(or)

```sh
pip install quaeso
```

## Usage example

### To get help with commandline arguments

```sh
quaeso --help
```

### Using Command-line Arguments

```sh
quaeso -f "some/folder/myrequest.yml"
```

(or)

```sh
quaeso -f "some/folder/myrequest.json"
```

### Colorize Output

```sh
quaeso -f "some/folder/myrequest.yml" -c
```

### Disclaimer

sometimes the quaeso command doesn't work in windows if the package is installed globally.

to avoid this, install the package in a local virtual env

first, create a env

```sh
python3 -m venv env_for_quaeso
```

activate that env

```sh
.\env_for_quaeso\Scripts\activate
```

and then pip install. But you will have to activate that env everytime you want to use quaeso.

## IO Redirection

the response is written to stdout and headers/status are written to stderr so that users can take IO redirection to their advantage. This works on windows, linux and mac.

```sh
quaeso -f "some/folder/myrequest.yml" > res.json 2> res_headers.txt
```

both stdout and stderr can be redirected to the same file

```sh
quaeso -f "some/folder/myrequest.yml" > res.txt 2>&1
```

## Sample request file (`myrequest.yml`)
